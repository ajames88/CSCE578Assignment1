The program will read in the entire directories as data.

All code is in 'program.py'.

This project is coded in version python2.7.10.

The program will read in the raw data, parse into sentences and then words.
The word tokens are then filtered to only include reporting verbs.
No word tokens are removed from the unfiltered set, so it does contain stop-words, numbers, and punctuation.
The top 10 most used reporting verbs in each set are then printed out along with the frequencies.
Output is printed to 'output.txt' in the current directory.

A file named 'myoutput.txt' contains the output I got on my final test of the program.

An analysis of my results can be found in 'Assignment 1 Analysis.pdf'.

The set of reporting verbs I used can be found in 'reportingverbs.txt'.
